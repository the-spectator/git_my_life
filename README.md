Welcome to [Git My Life](https://github.com/the-spectator/git_my_life) codebase, it is a project
we are aiming to build to record journal entries in git. You might ask why would you want to
_git commit_ a journal entry, the offical answer is because journally is like a git commit to the
life, hence _Git My Life_. Real answer is **Why Not?**

## What is Day In?

_Git My Life_ is a git / github backed journaling project.
